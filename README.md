Hi! 
My name is Abrahan and I'm currently a Software Engineer at Publix.


I've been developing programs for 3+ years now, some of my most common languages are:
- Go
- Python
- C#
- Rust

Outside of cloud work, I like to experiment with graphics using Vulkan, learn new languages and frameworks, as well as build custom pcs.
