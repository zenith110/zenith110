I enjoy tinkering with various forms of technology, from cloud to hardware such as Raspberry Pis. 
Technology is an outlet that incurs deep problem solving, and I'm happy to be within the field.
When not problem solving, you can find me creating or performing music on various instruments, as well as learning something new. I also blog my discoveries and thoughts on my website.
